        "details": "Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch\\n\\nIf you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.\\nBrief description\\nGoldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,\\n\\nYou can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.\\n\\nIf you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nInstalling NSP packages can be dangerous.\\n\\nKeep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.\\n\\nIf you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.\\n\\nGoldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.\\n\\nGoldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.\\n\\nThis can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.\\n\\nRemoving tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)\\n\\nMain features\\nSD card and NAND browser\\n\\nA very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:\\n\\nNSP (Nintendo Submission Package)\\n\\nIt's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.\\n\\nTechnically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).\\n\\nGoldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.\\n\\nAs a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.\\n\\nNRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)\\n\\nOfficially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.\\n\\nHomebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.\\n\\nNCA (Nintendo Content Archive)\\n\\nThis format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.\\n\\nWhile the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.\\n\\nNCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.\\n\\nSome NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.\\n\\nNCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.\\n\\nAppart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...\\n\\nGoldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.\\n\\nNXTheme (Home Menu theme)\\n\\nThis format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.\\n\\n+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.\\n\\nYou will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.\\n\\nNACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)\\n\\nThis is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.\\n\\nGoldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.\\n\\nTickets and certificates\\n\\nTickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).\\n\\nNSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.\\n\\nTo install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)\\n\\nThe NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.\\n\\nUSB installer and Goldtree\\n\\nYou can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.\\n\\nTitle manager\\n\\nGoldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.\\n\\nYou can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.\\n\\nTitles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.\\n\\nTicket manager\\n\\nGoldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.\\n\\nYou can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.\\n\\nTickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.\\n\\nCFW configuration\\n\\nThis is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.\\n\\nYou can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.\\n\\nConsole information\\n\\nOn this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.\\n\\nIt also displays the current firmware version the console is.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nDisplays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.\\n\\nAs some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.\\n\\nProviding keys\\nIf you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)\\n\\nUnless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.\\n\\nYou have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.\\n\\nGoldtree and USB installs\\nUSB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.\\n\\nGoldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.\\n\\nBasic controls\\nThe controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:\\n\\nPress A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)\\n\\nPress B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.\\n\\nPress X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.\\n\\nPress Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)\\n\\nMovement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.\\n\\nSpecial features\\nGoldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:\\n\\nGoldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.\\n\\nGoldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.\\n\\nGoldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.\\n\\nIssues and support\\nIn case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.\\n\\nMany errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:\\n\\nIt's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)\\n\\nThe USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install. If that happens, try closing Goldleaf and Goldtree, uninstalling the wrongly-installed title and retrying."
